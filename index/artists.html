  <p>Alicia Escott is an interdisciplinary artist practicing in solidarity with thinkers across fields undoing the construct of “nature” as a thing separated from us and our world. Escott is interested in how we each are negotiating our immediate day-to-day realities and responsibilities amid an awareness of the overarching specter of climate change, mass-extinction and the subsequent unspoken individual and collective experience of loss, heartbreak and longing— and related social and political unrest. She approaches these issues with an interstitial practice that encompasses writing, drawing, painting, photography, video, sculpture, social-practice and activism.
    <div class="smallspacer"> </div>
In 2019 Escott was an Artist in Residence at at Recology and at The Growlery both in San Francisco, she has previously been a fellow at Djerassi Art Residency, Anderson Ranch Arts Center, the JB Blunk Artist Residency and Irving Street Projects. Her work has been shown in over 80 art institutions, galleries and alternative spaces— including exhibitions at the Headlands Center for the Arts, the Berkeley Arts Center, Yerba Buena Center for the Arts, the San Francisco Maritime Museum, The Berkley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive, and The Museum of Contemporary Art Santa Barbra. She holds an MFA from California College of the Arts, where she received the Richard K. Price Scholarship and a BFA from the Art Institute of Chicago. Escott is a founding member of 100 Days Action and half of the Social Practice Project The Bureau of Linguistical Reality. Her work has been featured in the Economist, The new Yorker, KQED, MOMUS and many others </p>

  Born and bred Army Brat, I self-identify as being a loyal daughter, an eccentric sister, an old soul, and most importantly a creative just trying to consistently create.

  <div class="smallspacer"> </div>
In the spring of 2017, I graduated from Linfield College with a bachelor’s in Studio Arts & a minor in Art History. I am now living the post-grad life in Sacramento, CA. My first love is and will always be photography, but as of right now, my desire to explore the Black female body within relation to Afro-futuristic concepts has me dedicating my primary practice to paper/digital collage.

<div class="smallspacer"> </div>
It wasn’t until after I entered post-grad life and began re-evaluating my approach to my overall artistic practice, that I truly committed to the surprisingly inexpensive medium of collage. I had already been contemplating the ideas of The Divine Feminine in Space, Black feminism, future-past, and Pan African Diaspora identities after reading Yatasha Womack's Afrofuturism: The world of black sci-fi and fantasy culture . However, I didn't feel like my current medium, photography, could adequately address my new-found questions like, "What would a divine feminine in space look like? What if the Pan-African diaspora Identity was rooted in human cybernetic evolution?” "what does the reconstruction of the black female body in power inspire? With these questions and visual inspiration from artists Joshua Mays, Wangechi Mutu, Manzel Bowman, Taj Francis, and so many more notable artists, I have begun to philosophically and visually approach the wonderfully lush world of Afrofuturism within my work.
<div class="smallspacer"> </div>
Currently I have been working through these ideas on both digital and canvas media. The individual images collected into a whole allow for a cohesive collage in which the the viewer can find meaning both through the singular and the whole. Almost similar to that of a mural. To reiterate the open-ended narratives within my compositions, I form the titles into short incomplete thoughts or sentences, Leading the reader through a stream of consciousness. These titles finish abruptly without a definite end, encouraging the viewer to find their ...
